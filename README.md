# VotingApp
VotingApp: Backend application built using C#, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and Signal R. This is a good example of how to use Clean Architecture in a .Net application to make it more testable and maintainable. Signal R was implemented to present a real time dashboard of the Polls. Testing with XUnit has been implemented to make the code more reliable against future changes.
